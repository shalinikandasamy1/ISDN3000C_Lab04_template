Brief Network Setup Description

The RDK-X5 development board is configured with a default static IP address of 192.168.127.10 on its Ethernet interface (eth0). This default static IP is preset by the manufacturer to enable direct wired connection for development and testing.

My laptopâ€™s Ethernet interface is configured with a static IP address within the same subnet, usually 192.168.127.12, and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This ensures both devices are on the same private local network without requiring a gateway or DHCP server.

The RDK-X5 and laptop are connected directly using an Ethernet cable. This direct connection facilitates seamless SSH access and TCP socket communication without interference from other networking equipment.

The RDK-X5 also typically maintains an independent Wi-Fi connection on its wireless interface (wlan0), providing internet access and acting as a secure management channel separate from the Ethernet interface.

Data Format Chosen

The communication between the client and server uses the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data format.

When the client sends the request message "GET_DATA", the server gathers system information including:

Device MAC address (eth0)

System uptime

Current timestamp in ISO format

This information is structured as a Python dictionary and then serialized to a JSON string before being sent back to the client.

The client receives the JSON string, parses it back into a dictionary, and displays the system information in a user-friendly format.

The choice of JSON ensures that data is easily exchangeable, human-readable, and compatible with almost any programming language or platform.
